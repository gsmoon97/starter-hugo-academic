summary: ALLECS, a lightweight web application to serve grammatical error
  correction (GEC) systems, consists of two modules, web-interface and gec-api.
  We suggest deploying the gec-api on a GPU-powered server and the web-interface
  on a CPU-focused server. However, both modules can be deployed on the same
  server. Refer to the instruction in each module for installation.
